<h1><a href="https://coderbyte.com/information/Bracket%20Matcher" _blank>Here's the challenge : :link:</a></h1>

Have the function BracketMatcher(str) take the str parameter being passed and return 1 if the brackets are correctly matched and each one is accounted for. Otherwise return 0. For example: if str is "(hello (world))", then the output should be 1, but if str is "((hello (world))" the the output should be 0 because the brackets do not correctly match up. Only "(" and ")" will be used as brackets. If str contains no brackets return 1.
